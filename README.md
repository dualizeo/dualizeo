 The only thing that saddens me in this github commuinity are developers being condesending to newcomers, assuming new people joining will know all the in's and out details to start using their software.

 There is a memorable company out there that is successful->🍎 they make things without judgement "easy to use, easy to understand" they don't assume people know how to "compile" "export variables" "memorize terminal commands"

 Memorizing is a thing of the past, it's called Cognitive Offloading.

 If developers cared about their projects, they would take the time to provide documentation, beginner friendly (Inspire people) as if you were to explain this to a child, since some of us are brand new to systems. Sometimes we don't have enough time and would prefer to get to where we need to (using your software) and that will results in happy users!
This would gain developers more support from contributions to their project!
It might be a bit more of extra work but Simple documentation goes a long way to have more people joining your community to grow 🌱 it's simple as that.

example:
- 😀New Users Guide ( motivated people wanting to use )
- 😉Community Guide ( people wanting to know more )
- 😎Developers Guide ( people wanting to help the community )
