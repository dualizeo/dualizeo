 The only thing that saddens me in this github commuinity are the developers being condesending to newcomers, assuming new people joining projects will know all the in's and out "details" to start using their software.

 There is a memorable company out there 🍎 and they make things without judgement "easy to use, easy to understand" they don't assume people know how to "compile" "export variables" "memorize terminal commands" when using their software.

 Memorizing is a thing of the past, it's called Cognitive Offloading.

 If developers cared for their projects, they would take the time to provide documentation, beginner friendly (Inspire people) as if you were to explain this to a child, since some people are brand new to the systems. Sometimes we don't have enough time to understand the entire complex build and would rather prefer to get to where we need to (using your software) which will result in higher project stars.
This would gain developers more support and contributions to their project!
It might be a bit more of extra work but Simple documentation goes a long way to have more people joining your community to grow 🌱

example:
- 😀New Users Guide ( motivated people wanting to use )
- 😉Community Guide ( people wanting to know more )
- 😎Developers Guide ( people wanting to help the community )
